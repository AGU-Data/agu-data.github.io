# The Earth, Space, and Environmental Sciences Global Data Convening

Earth, space and environmental science global research communities rely on the accessibility and continuity of critical datasets and data systems in the scientific ecosystem. However, natural hazards, funding changes, geopolitical actions, and other factors can create disruptions that hinder scientific research and application.

To mitigate these risks, AGU is convening the global community to develop a roadmap that moves us towards a sustainable and enduring solution. This convening is supported by generous funding from the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation.
 
We have invited representatives from across the broad research infrastructure community to participate in the upcoming convening, 23-27 March in Berlin, Germany. This is an in-person event with minimal hybrid coverage. 
  
## Convening Purpose and Desired Outcomes:
- The convening will establish a **global collaborative network** with a common set of goals that help meet the needs of the Earth, space, and environmental science community now and into the future. 
- The convening will produce **a roadmap** for the Earth, space, and environmental science global data community to secure a sustainable and resilient future. The steps identified in the roadmap are to be actionable, support immediate implementation, and foundational for ongoing operations.
- The convening will **secure commitment** from the attendees to continue working in coalition and global collaboration, including pathways to reaching consensus on governance principles.
- The convening will finalize **best practices for dataset mitigation** of near-term threats and put in motion activities to address those threats.
- The convening will produce a **draft working document** articulating the outcomes, action items, and next steps to developing and implementing a global data framework.
