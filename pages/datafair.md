**Presenter:** Lisa Kempler, MathWorks

**Date:** Tuesday, 16 December\
**Time:** 15:00\
**Title:** A Free, Open-Access Tool for Remote Sensing Field Campaign Planning Using Satellite Overpass and Calibration Site Data\
**Description:** FieldAssist-Cal is an open-source, web-based application designed to support the remote sensing community in planning field campaigns for vicarious calibration, cross-calibrations, ground sampling, and environmental monitoring. The tool provides an integrated environment that combines multi-sensor satellite overpass predictions, local weather forecasts, and site-specific metadata to help researchers align field activities with optimal observational conditions.
Users can select a Region of Interest (ROI) or specify a location, then explore upcoming pass times, solar geometry, sensor viewing angles, and associated weather parameters to optimize field readiness. For calibration-focused workflows, FieldAssist-Cal enables users to generate Top-of-Atmosphere (TOA) reflectance from Google Earth Engine for Landsat and Sentinel missions. Researchers can select date-specific windows and produce time-series plots, supporting temporal analysis and pre-campaign evaluation.
Planned future enhancements will allow users to store generated time-series plots and associated datasets within the platform, enabling quick retrieval during ongoing research rather than regenerating results. This capability is designed to save significant time for researchers, scientists, and students working across Earth observation disciplines.
As a community-driven, open-access tool, FieldAssist-Cal promotes time savings, effective planning, reproducibility, transparency, and overall efficiency in field campaign preparation and calibration support.\
